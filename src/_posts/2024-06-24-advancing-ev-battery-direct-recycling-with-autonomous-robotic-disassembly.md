Electric vehicles (EVs) are taking over the automotive industry and as their powerful lithium-ion batteries begin to reach their end of life, the need for efficient recycling solutions for those batteries is becoming more and more critical. Battery powered equipment is also taking over trucking, bicycles, scooters, motorcycles, marine craft, tractors, forklifts, lawnmowers, drones and many other types of equipment, not to mention the growing number of humanoid robot companies preparing for mass production like Tesla, Agility, Figure AI and Boston Dynamics all powered by lithium-ion batteries. There is also an explosion in building and grid energy storage with lithium-ion technology in residential, commercial, industrial and utility scale applications to help the world adopt more wind and solar power.

Lithium-ion batteries are made with several chemistries, but all use some combination of valuable materials like nickel, manganese, cobalt, aluminum, copper and of course lithium. Many of these critical materials are mined outside the United States and some materials will be in scarce supply based on the projected numbers of batteries we will need, particularly cobalt.

Aside from lithium, the rest of the materials are not actually used up by the battery so they still exist in their original quantities in a battery at its end of life. The problem is recovering them.

At Rose City Robotics, we are developing autonomous robotic systems to enhance the recycling process of lithium-ion batteries. Our mission is to enable the autonomous disassembly of large lithium-ion batteries like the ones used in electric vehicles, recovering valuable materials with greater efficiency and lower emissions.

### The Need for Autonomous Robotic Disassembly

#### Ideal Recycling Process
The best way to recycle a lithium-ion battery is called direct recycling. Direct recycling involves disassembling the battery packs to get at the cells within which recovers the most material with the lowest environmental and energy footprint. When a battery reaches its end of life, it may be because only one or two cells have gone bad. The good cells can be repackaged for use in other applications, either in rebuilt batteries for EVs or for other purposes like energy storage for buildings or utilities. Bad cells that are not usable can then be shredded to recover the materials through a chemical processes called hydrometallurgy.

#### Current Recycling Methods
Unfortunately today, direct recycling is not used for the vast majority of batteries that are recycled. Currently, most batteries that come in to recycling centers with over 30% of charge are burned whole and the materials are recovered through a process called pyrometallurgy. This is a challenging process since the whole pack is burned, it contains a lot of carbon which binds with the valuable materials, making them more difficult to recover.

Batteries that come in under a 30% charge of are simply shredded whole, then recovered using hydrometallurgy. Again, since the whole pack is shredded together it takes lots of energy and strong acids to recover the materials. If a battery has over 30% charge, pyrometallurgy makes more sense as the charge is too high for shredding and it would be too challenging and time consuming to discharge to a safe level.

Both burning and shredding whole battery packs are not only inefficient but also environmentally damaging. The recycling process involves significant emissions and fails to recover valuable materials optimally. This is where the need for direct recycling and a more refined, autonomous approach becomes evident.

#### Challenges of Direct Recycling
When batteries are delivered to recyclers from scrap yards they come in a wide variety of conditions. Some scrap yards store them outside due to fear of fire and they are often covered in rust, dirt, grease and grime. Batteries may be bent or damaged if they are dropped and bumped during the transportation process.

#### Dangers to Humans

In addition, batteries may come in at varying levels of charge and nearly all with at least some charge. Due to the fact that they become unstable (catch on fire) at low charge, batteries have a built in safety mechanism to ensure they always retain a certain minium charge. This means nearly every large battery is dangerous to work on for human workers due to risk of electrical shock. The batteries also contain hazardous materials which can be harmful to human health if not handled properly and can become unstable when being disassembled, meaning fire risk.

#### No Standardization of Fastenings
Manufacturers also make their own proprietary battery packs that are sealed and fastened in a variety of ways including fusion welding, ultrasonic welding, ultrasonic bonding, industrial adhesives like epoxy, silicone and acrylic or mechanical fasteners like screws, rivets, or bolts. This means that each battery pack is unique and requires a custom approach to disassembly. The rapid pace of innovation in the EV industry also means that battery packs are constantly evolving with many manufacturers changing up their battery packs multiple times per year, making it challenging to develop a standardized approach to disassembly even within the same brand of battery.

Given these dangers and challenges, its simply not feasible for humans to disassemble each battery pack so its more practical right now to just either burn or shred the battery packs whole.

#### Why Autonomous Robots?
Autonomous robots offer a promising solution by enabling direct recycling of battery packs. Robots are well suited for dangerous jobs dealing with high voltage electricity and hazardous materials, removing the risk to human workers.

Overcoming the challenge of fastener defeating calls for for intelligent and adaptive robotics that can learn on the job, from other robots in a network as well as from humans, videos and product documentation.

Robotic equipment offers precise disassembly, recovering materials with greater efficiency and significantly reducing downstream emissions in the recycling process. Leveraging machine learning and transformer neural networks, we are developing robots that can use sensor and vision data to learn to perform these dangerous and challenging tasks with adaptive intelligence and continuous learning capabilities.

### Technological Innovations in Robotics

#### Leveraging Machine Learning
Our approach at Rose City Robotics involves collecting and utilizing sensor and vision data to train transformer neural networks to provide robots with predictive motion planning capabilities. This allows our robots to train on complex tasks, enabling them to perform precise disassembly operations autonomously. This process is called imitation learning, where robots learn from human demonstrations and other robots in a network using [research pioneered by Stanford University](https://mobile-aloha.github.io/).

#### Sensor and Vision Data Integration
We are developing [systems for capturing training data from human demonstrations](https://rosecityrobotics.com/2024/05/08/data-collection-methodologies-for-ai-driven-robotics/). By integrating training data gathered from our sensors and vision systems, we provide our robots with the necessary data to understand and navigate the intricate structures of EV battery packs. This data is crucial for training custom robots to perform these tasks safely and efficiently.

### Benefits of Autonomous Robotic Disassembly
Autonomous robotic disassembly allows for more precise material recovery compared to traditional methods. By directly disassembling battery packs, autonomous robots can recover valuable materials such as nickel, manganese, cobalt, aluminum, copper and lithium more efficiently. Also good cells can be extracted before the recycling process and returned directly to use, which saves a considerable amount of embodied manufacturing energy and cost.

Traditional methods like burning and shredding packs whole result in high levels of emissions, whereas direct recycling with autonomous robotics minimizes environmental impact through precise and controlled operations and more efficient extraction of valuable materials.

Battery recycling involves handling hazardous materials with electrical charge, which poses safety risks to human workers. Autonomous robots mitigate these risks by performing dangerous tasks, ensuring a safer working environment.

### Market and Industry Landscape

#### Growth of EV Market
The EV market is growing rapidly, with EVs projected to constitute 40% of global car sales by 2030. This growth increases the demand for efficient recycling solutions to manage the influx of used batteries. Since batteries reach their end of life in 10-15 years, by 2030 experts at Argonne National Labs expect the United States will need to recycle 1 million tons of EV batteries and this number is growing exponentially, with over 100 million tons of batteries to be recycled by 2035. At Rose City Robotics we are working to ensure that our technologies remain at the cutting edge of the industry and that our robotic solutions are adaptable and scalable as batteries continue to evolve.

#### Current Recycling Capacity
While China leads the world in recycling capacity, the EU and the US are still developing their industries. Experts estimate the current recycling capacity in the US to be approximately 200,000 tons of batteries per year. Policymakers are increasingly pressuring the EV sector to ensure that batteries are designed for circularity, containing recycled content, and that recyclers recover larger shares of materials. EU regulations now require that 25% of materials in new batteries must be recycled content.

#### Scarcity of Critical Materials
The demand for EV batteries is driving up the demand for critical materials like cobalt, nickel, and lithium. These materials are not only scarce but also have a high environmental impact when mined. By developing efficient recycling solutions, we can reduce the need for mining and mitigate the environmental impact of battery production. It is estimated that by 2030, the demand for cobalt will exceed the current global production capacity, making recycling an essential part of the EV industry.

#### Environmental Impacts
The production of lithium-ion batteries has a significant environmental impact, with emissions from battery production expected to increase by 800% by 2040. By developing efficient recycling solutions, we can reduce the environmental impact of battery production and mitigate the emissions associated with the recycling process. It is estimated that batteries produced with recycled materials result in up to 30% lower carbon emissions that those using virgin materials. Autonomous robotic disassembly offers an even more sustainable solution for managing end-of-life batteries, further reducing emissions and minimizing environmental impact.

#### The Future of EV Battery Recycling

At Rose City Robotics we believe the future of EV battery recycling lies in direct recycling using autonomous robotic disassembly. We are committed to advancing this technology to increase safety, reduce emissions and enable the continued growth of electric vehicles and battery technology, which we believe will benefit humanity and provide a positive climate impact. By leveraging machine learning we are developing intelligent, adaptive robots that revolutionize the recycling process.

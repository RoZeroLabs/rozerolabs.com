Our company is evolving! Effective immediately, we are changing our name from Rose City Robotics to **RoZero Labs**.

Along with this rebrand, we are excited to introduce our latest prototype: RoZero Bot (also known as RoZe), which we are now using in our lab to collect machine learning datasets.

This prototype will help us to develop a proof of concept for our autonomous disassembly system for EV batteries by demonstrating that we can collect human guided training data and use that data to train a transformer neural network. We will then demonstrate our ability to transfer skills from the human to the RoZe to be performed autonomously.

Yes we watched the Jetson's growing up and RoZero Bot is an homage to [Rosie the Robot](https://thejetsons.fandom.com/wiki/Rosey_the_Robot_(episode)), the autonomous robot housekeeper of the Jetson family. We also believe that the existential need to mobilize the world against climate change requires a movement akin to the 'We Can Do It' spirit of [Rosie the Riveter](https://hbr.org/1993/07/whatever-happened-to-rosie-the-riveter).

### Introducing RoZero Bot aka RoZe

Built on Stanford University's open-source [ALOHA platform](https://mobile-aloha.github.io/), RoZe allows a human operator to control two robotic arms with precision. Its three onboard cameras and onboard laptop capture video and joint position data, which can then be used as machine learning training data to train a transformer neural network.

This advanced system enables the transfer of skills to RoZe, allowing it to perform tasks autonomously after being trained by human demonstration. This leap forward in robotics and machine learning is enabled by the advancements in transformer neural networks, the technology behind Large Language Models like ChatGPT. Transformer neural networks are essentially prediction machines, but instead of using the to predict language tokens to write text, we use them to predict motion control signals to move RoZe.

While RoZe is a rudimentary prototype working with small scale batteries like e-bike batteries, our vision is to develop an EV-battery pack scale system which has the ability to learn and evolve through AI, gathering knowledge provided by human demonstration to enhance its capabilities and becoming autonomous over time.

### We are now RoZero Labs

Why the name change? We will always be proud of our Portland roots, symbolized by the "RoZe" in our new name, as well as our amazing climate-tech community in the Pacific Northwest, but we have larger aspirations beyond the region. We aim to lead the way in transforming lithium-ion battery recycling, introducing circularity and striving for zero waste in recycling processes for zero-emissions vehicle batteries. The 'Zero' in our name reflects our commitment to circularity and sustainability and the 'Labs' our commitment to innovation.

As part of this transition, we have acquired the domain [https://rozerolabs.com](https://rozerolabs.com) and have moved all systems to this domain. Our existing @rosecityrobotics.com email addresses will still work but in the future we can be contacted @rozerolabs.com. Stay tuned for exciting updates as RoZero Labs takes on the challenge of revolutionizing robotics and advancing the future of sustainable technology.

Thank you for your continued support as we embark on this exciting new journey!

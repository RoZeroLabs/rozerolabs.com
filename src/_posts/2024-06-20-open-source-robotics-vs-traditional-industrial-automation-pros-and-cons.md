As a robotics integrator, we focus on using machine learning to enhance automation hardware. Our focus on sensor systems for capturing training data and neural networks for imitation learning allows us to enable robots to autonomously perform tasks that are difficult or impossible to automate with traditional methods. This approach is akin to how large language models operate, but instead of predicting the next token, we train robots to predict the next motion given what they see in front of them relative to the training data they have been provided.

In this quickly developing field, we have the option to utilize either traditional industrial robotics hardware from established partners like FANUC, Zebra, and Universal Robots or to explore new low-cost open-source models such as Stanford's ALOHA Robot and the Annin Robotics AR4. Each type of hardware has its pros and cons, which we will explore in this article.

- **Support and Maintenance:** Established manufacturers and their distribution networks can provide extensive support networks and comprehensive maintenance services, ensuring minimal downtime and quick resolution of issues.
- **Compatibility and Integration:** These robots integrate seamlessly with existing industrial systems, allowing for smooth transitions and upgrades within established workflows.
- **Advanced Features:** Industrial robots come equipped with sophisticated functionalities and precision capabilities, making them suitable for high-stakes applications that require accuracy and repeatability.

**Disadvantages of Traditional Industrial Hardware**

- **Cost:** The high upfront costs and ongoing maintenance expenses can be prohibitive for smaller businesses and startups and limit the possible applications with an acceptable return on investment.
- **Complexity:** Operating and maintaining these robots require specialized knowledge and training. Additionally, reliance on OEM parts can add to the complexity, cost and difficulty of repairs which can extend downtimes.
- **Flexibility:** Industrial robots typically run on closed-source proprietary software, often written in their own proprietary scripting language. Operators need to understand how to operate custom graphical user interface or write in custom scripting languages to program tasks, which can add raise barriers to utilizing multiple hardware vendors and add to vendor lock in. While many vendors do offer integrations with open source software like ROS2, their overall dependence on proprietary software can limit their exposure to rapid changes and new technologies happening in open-source communities.

### Application of Machine Learning and Imitation Learning

**Introduction to Imitation Learning**
Imitation learning involves training robots to perform tasks by mimicking human actions using transformer neural networks. This is similar to how large language models predict the next token in a sequence, but in this case predicting the next motion or action in a sequence. Transfering skills via machine learning offers significant advantages over traditional automation methods, which are far more rigid and prescriptive and require a technician to program specific routines and steps in a script.

The main hurtle to overcome for applying machine learning to robotics is the need for quality training data, which is not as readily available as language training data is on the internet. At Rose City Robotics, we are developing [systems for capturing training data from human demonstrations](https://rosecityrobotics.com/2024/05/08/data-collection-methodologies-for-ai-driven-robotics/) and using that data to train neural networks for imitation learning.

**Implementation in Traditional Hardware**
Traditional industrial robots can integrate computer vision and machine learning models to enhance their capabilities. For instance, [FANUC robots have been used in recycling applications](https://www.fanucamerica.com/case-studies/robots-enhance-efficiency-at-millennium-recycling) where computer vision and machine learning algorithms optimize the picking and placing of materials, improving efficiency and reducing errors.

**Implementation in Low-Cost Open-Source Models**
Open-source models benefit strongly from machine learning integration. The ALOHA Robot, for example, can be programmed with imitation learning algorithms to perform complex tasks in research and educational settings, showcasing the potential for low-cost, high-flexibility automation solutions. The fact that low cost hardware does not have the same repeatability and precision is balanced by the robots ability to error correct in real time.

As the co-founder of Rose City Robotics, I am beyond thrilled to share our experience at this year’s Bend Venture Conference (BVC), where we were honored to win the Audience Favorite Award. The 21st annual Bend Venture Conference was held at Tower Theatre on October 17-18, 2024. Fourteen impressive finalists pitched their innovative ideas and business models over two days to hundreds of people, including angel investors, venture capitalists and startup founders. It was an incredible experience being among such visionary companies and investors, each one contributing to the vibrant entrepreneurial landscape here in Oregon.

Of the 14 finalists, six companies received well-deserved recognition or funding, and a total of $500,000 was committed to four companies. Additional deals are still being worked out, which is a great testament to the impact BVC continues to have on fostering growth and innovation in Oregon and beyond.

Jon Stark, the CEO of EDCO, captured the spirit of the event perfectly when he said, "It has been incredible to witness the cross-industry collaboration and entrepreneurial energy that has fueled High Desert Innovation Week. Attendees came from around the state and the country to participate in BVC and events hosted by EDCO, Central Oregon Innovation Network, Cultivate Bend, and Bend Outdoor Worx. It is truly inspiring to witness first-hand the economic power of Central Oregon’s entrepreneurial community.”

Being part of BVC this year was an unforgettable experience. The event has been Central Oregon’s flagship entrepreneurship event for over two decades, and it was clear how this platform serves as a vital connector for startups like ours with investors and industry leaders. BVC is structured to provide exposure and opportunities for startups at various stages of development, whether they are in growth, early stages, or new economy categories. I’ve seen firsthand how the connections made at BVC can lay the foundation for future success, not just for individual companies but for the entire entrepreneurial ecosystem in Oregon.

Brian Vierra, EDCO’s Venture Catalyst, summed it up when he said, “EDCO and the BVC ecosystem of partners are committed to nurturing these relationships, offering resources and support to foster the continued growth of participating companies. We extend our heartfelt gratitude to the sponsors, angel investors and participating funds, whose unwavering support makes this program possible.”

### Audience Favorite Award

Winning the Audience Favorite Award is a huge honor for Rose City Robotics. Over 60 companies competed in the Early Stage Track with three rounds of pitch competitions over the past three months. In addition to winning the Audience Favorite Award at the finals, Rose City Robotics also had the honor of winning the [Audience Favorite Award at the semifinals](/2024/09/30/rose-city-robotics-wins-audience-favorite-award-and-advances-to-finals-at-bend-venture-conference/) along with a $3,000 cash prize. Competing in the Early Stage Track against so many other innovative companies pushed us to deliver our very best. This track features companies still in the proof-of-concept or early-revenue stage, and we were evaluated on key factors like revenue potential, market proof, scalability, and, of course, the passion and experience of the founders. To have such an esteemed audience of investors vote us as their favorite means so much to our team.

We're immensely grateful to EDCO and BVC for creating this incredible platform, and to everyone who has supported us on this journey. In particular we'd like to thank Josh Carter and Ben Parish from [Upstart Collective](https://www.upstartcollective.org/) for sponsoring our BVC application as well as all of those in the community who helped us practice and hone our pitch. Upstart is a founder-first co-working community that Rose City Robotics has had the privelege of being a part of this year. Also a big thanks to our presentation and public speaking coaches Spenser Meeks, Allie Persitz and Lisa Hovey as well as Alyssa Ellis for helping us create this award winning presentation. The recognition we’ve received here at BVC is just the beginning, and we are excited for what the future holds for Rose City Robotics.

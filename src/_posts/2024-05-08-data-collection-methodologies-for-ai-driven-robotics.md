In traditional automation and robotics, the tasks performed by machines must be rigidly prescriptive, structured, and well-defined. Movements are mapped to precise locations, operations are ordered in sequences and a script lists the actions, parameters and repeated processes. This works well for high volume, low mix tasks where there are a small number of variations in possible objects the robot will interact with, but not so well for use cases which do not fit this mold.

This is because an operator must reprogram the robot for each new object or variation in movement. High volume, low mix processes can justify this human work by allocating out that fixed overhead over a large number of automated actions.

Where traditional robotics and automation hardware fall short are in more challenging tasks. For example tasks which include low volumes with unstructured or a high mix of variations in the possible objects the robot will interact with. For this case, it is typically not economically feasible for the operator to reprogram the robot for each low volume run many times for the high mix of objects.

This is where the power of AI and intelligent robotics comes into play. At Rose City Robotics, our innovative approaches in data collection and robotic training using neural networks enable us to add layers of intelligence and capabilities to any robotics hardware. This enables the robots to be more adaptable, learn on the fly and intuitively decide on next actions based on its broader training dataset.

A robot will need to be trained to do any new task and the essential first step of that process is collecting sample data of a human performing the task. In order to train a neural network on the intricacies of the task, we need to collect somewhere in the range of 50-100 examples of a human, or leader robot operated by a human doing that task using carefully placed video and sensors.

### The Role of Data in AI Robotics

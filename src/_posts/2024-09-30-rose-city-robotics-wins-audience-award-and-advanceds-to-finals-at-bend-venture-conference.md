Last week, we won the Early Stage Audience Award with a $3,000 cash prize and advanced to the finals with a chance to pitch at this year's [Bend Venture Conference](https://www.bendvc.com/). Bend Venture Conference is the Pacific Northwest's largest angel conference and for over two decades, BVC has served as a pillar of Oregon’s robust entrepreneurial culture, playing a pivotal role in evolving and growing the startup ecosystem across the Pacific Northwest. Throughout the conference, attendees hear company pitches, participate in multiple networking activities and listen to inspiring presenters from across the United States.

Demolicious is hosted monthly in Portland Oregon, organized by Rick Turoczy and Upstart Collective's Josh Carter. Teams get just 3 minutes to pitch their idea with slides. Since its inception in 2008, Demolicious has served as Portland’s premier launchpad for groundbreaking ideas.

We got to take home the infamous Demolicious belt and have added our Rose City Robotics Sticker.

Securing the Demolicious belt is an exciting milestone, but this journey is just beginning. The next challenge will be defending our title at the October 24th event, and ultimately, facing off against the best of the best in December at the "Champion of Champions" competition.

So, if you’re in Bend on October 17th, [come watch](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/2024-bend-venture-conference-tickets-945142515707?aff=oddtdtcreator)
